![pacman](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/da/61/60/da61606b5c06cbac4330860b17ee6ad2.jpg)

This is an exercise designed to create Pacmen and send them through digital time and space at random directions and velocities.

## Description

This is a coding exercise assigned through the MIT xPro "Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN" course. The purpose of this exercise was to simulate an incredibly simplified version of the Pacman arcade game using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, array manipulation and DOM manipulation.

## Installation

Click the green "Code" button and download the .zip folder containing the repo to your local machine. Once it is downloaded, expand the folder and double click the index.html file to open it up in your default browser.

## Usage

When you click the "Add PacMan" button, a new pacman should appear at a random position within the top left corner of the screen.
When you click the "Start Game" button, the pacman or pacmen created should start moving at random velocity on the screen.
When a given pacman hits the edge of the screen, it should change position to stay within the frame of the web page.

## Roadmap

* Set up a maze type environment that the pacman or pacmen can navigate through
* Modify the styling to further resemble that 8-bit, arcade game style
* Allow Pacman to be controlled by using the direction pad of the keyboard.
* Create dots that pacman has to eat as he makes it through the maze.
* At the end of the maze, have the pacman eat cherries, that cause the game to reset to a new, more difficult level.
