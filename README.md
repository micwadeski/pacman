#Pacman

This is an exercise to mimic the Pacman game.

##Description

This is a coding exercise assigned through the MIT xPro "Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN" course. The object of this exercise is to create a very basic sample of Pacman's movement, using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and an array of images.

##Installation

Download the index.html file and four .png image files. The index.html file can be run in any web browser, while hosted either locally or on a remote web server. You can run the index.html in this repo file by visting this URL: https://dcdiaz.github.io/pacman/index.html

##Usage

The current version of this program allows Pacman to only move right and left, reversing direction when he reaches the window's edge. The "dots" he chomps are being dynamically generated, but do not expect the dots to disappear when Pacman chomps them. That is still a "To Do" item for the near future.

##Support

I can be reached via email at david@d2weblogic.com, or connect with me on LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-diaz-b64aa88a/

##Roadmap

Have Pacman actually eat the dots, so they disappear.
Modify the CSS to more closely emulate the original Pacman game styling.
Allow Pacman to also move vertically.
Allow Pacman's directiom to be controlled by keyboard input.

##License information

To be determined.
